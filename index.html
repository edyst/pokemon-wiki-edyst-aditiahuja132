        <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
        <p>Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company
            as
            part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first
            games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs),
            also
            referred as the "core series" by their developers</p>

                <h4>Water</h4>
                <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Water
                    is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other
                    sea-dwelling creatures.</p>

                <h4>Fire</h4>
                <p>Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Fire
                    types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter
                    is
                    often a plus.</p>

                    players.Grass
                    is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are
                    resistant to
                    Grass moves.</p>

                    out
                    their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves.
                    A
                    Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and

        <h2>Q and A</h2>
        <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
                    Pikachu
                    is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary
                    chain.
                    Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts
                    of
                    electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
                    Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
                </li>
                <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
                    progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon
                    who
                    emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point
                    where
                    you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no
                    button
                    mashing at all is required.
                </li>

                    slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought
